In the Artificial Intelligence Hackathon organized by Kuika, I am describing the process of developing an innovative chatbot within 24 hours. This chatbot significantly improves company operations, especially by supporting the interpretation and analysis of production data. Additionally, it provides information about personal permission rights, service details, and general documents such as PDF and Word files.

As part of our software architecture, we employ **Flask** as the API framework to facilitate seamless communication between our
**Flutter** mobile applications and **Next.js** web interfaces. For our vector databases, we utilize Mongo Vector Search, ChromaDB, and Pgvector, ensuring efficient and scalable data retrieval.
To guarantee robust and reliable connections, we implement LangChain and Langraph technologies, enhancing our system's overall performance and integration capabilities.

These are our plans according to the timeline. We developed our product gradually, focusing on continuous optimization. Consequently,
we paid close attention to our plans and strategies to ensure the product operates efficiently and effectively.

On the backend, I developed a service that operates through Flask API and contains three different tables: 'user', 'session', and 'chat'. I integrated this service with a frontend built on Next.js, and later connected this service to artificial intelligence to make our system more functional. Additionally, I implemented necessary security measures to ensure end-to-end encryption for Flask and the chatbot.

Finally, with the remaining time, I developed a mobile application using Flutter. This application made the services I developed operational on mobile devices as well, aiming to provide our users with uninterrupted service across all platforms.

The system I developed during this Hackathon stands out for its seamless integration between different technologies and high security standards.
